# Editoria  

## 1.1.4  

#### Wax Editor  
* Fix for unsaved changes warning  

## 1.1.3  

* New design for the book builder, the dashboard and the theme  

#### Dashboard  
* Renamed 'remove' button to 'delete' for consistency with the book builder  
* Double clicking on a book will take you to the book builder for that book, instead of opening the renaming interface  
* The position of 'Edit' and 'Rename' actions have been swapped ('Edit' now comes first)  
* Books now appear in alphabetical order  

#### Book Builder  
* Fixed issue with fragments disappearing when uploading multiple files  
* Renamed 'Front Matter' and 'Back Matter' to 'Frontmatter' and 'Backmatter'  

#### Wax Editor  
* Introduce layouts  
* Accept configuration options (`layout` and `lockWhenEditing`)  
* It is now broken down into three separate modules (pubsweet integration, react integration and core) for better separation of concerns  
* Diacritics work within notes
