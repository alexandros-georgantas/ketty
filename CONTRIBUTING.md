# CONTRIBUTING

Ketida is both an open source software project (https://gitlab.coko.foundation/ketida/ketida) and an open community, part of the broader Collaborative Knowledge Foundation (https://coko.foundation/) (Coko) community. We welcome people of all kinds to join the community and contribute with knowledge, skills, expertise. Everyone is welcome in our chat room (https://mattermost.coko.foundation/coko/channels/ketida).

In order to contribute to Ketida,you're expected to follow a few sensible guidelines. Please read our [Community Products Collaboration Guidelines](https://docs.coko.foundation/s/community-collab)

## Search first, ask questions later

If you want to create a new component, a feature or if you've experienced a bug or want to discuss something in the issue trackers, please search before you start developing to find out whether it already exists.

## Discuss your contribution before you build

Please let us know about the contribution you plan to make before you start it. Either comment on a relevant existing issue, or open a new issue if you can't find an existing one. This helps us avoid duplicating effort and to ensure contributions are likely to be accepted. You can also ask in the chat room (https://mattermost.coko.foundation/coko/channels/ketida) if you are unsure.

For contributions made as discussions and suggestions, you can at any time open an RFC in our issue tracker and Ketida community members and maintainers will be happy to jump into a discussion.
