# Editoria  

This is the Editoria monorepo.  

It consists of the main Editoria application, as well as the different [Pubsweet](https://gitlab.coko.foundation/pubsweet) components and helper libraries that the app is made of.  

This application is being developed by the [Coko Foundation](https://coko.foundation/), for the [University of California Press](http://www.ucpress.edu/).  
For more information, visit the project's [website](https://editoria.pub/) or our [chat channel](https://mattermost.coko.foundation/coko/channels/editoria).  
For the editor that Editoria uses, see its related project [Wax](https://gitlab.coko.foundation/wax/wax).

## Get up and running  

Get your copy of the repository.  
```sh
git clone https://gitlab.coko.foundation/editoria/editoria.git
cd editoria
```

Make sure you use you use `node >= 8.3`.

### nvm
To determine which version of Node you are running type `node -v`. 
If the version is not 8.3 or greater you will need to use nvm to prescribe a specific node version. Installation of nvm is covered here https://github.com/creationix/nvm#installation

Once nvm is installed use the command `nvm install 8.3`

For further information on how to use nvm see https://www.sitepoint.com/quick-tip-multiple-versions-node-nvm/

### Install yarn
```sh
npm install -g yarn
```

### Install Dependencies
Install all dependencies and navigate to the editoria app folder.  
```sh
yarn
cd packages/editoria-app
```

Create a `config/local-development.json` file.  
Edit that to enter your database secret, as well as to connect to [INK](https://gitlab.coko.foundation/INK/ink-api).  
In this file, add the following:  
```json
{
    "pubsweet-server": {
        "secret": "<your-secret-here>"
    },
    "pubsweet-component-ink-backend": {
        "inkEndpoint": "< your-ink-api-endpoint >",
        "email": "< your-ink-email >",
        "password": "< your-ink-password >",
        "recipes": {
            "editoria-typescript": "< editoria-typescript-recipe-id >"
        }
    }
}
```
Ensure that:
* the `<your-ink-api-endpoint>` in `local-development.json` ends with a trailing slash
* if INK is running as a service on a port, it is on port `3000`

Create environment files for each profile of the application under editoria-app/config
You will need two files:
development.env
production.env

The contents of these files should export the appropriate values for each environment:
```json
export PUBSWEET_SECRET='dev_secret'
export POSTGRES_USER='dev'
export POSTGRES_PASSWORD='secretpassword'
export POSTGRES_HOST='localhost'
export POSTGRES_DB='editoria_dev'
export POSTGRES_PORT='5460'
export SERVER_PORT='3000'
export INK_ENDPOINT='http://138.68.41.18:3000/'
export INK_USERNAME='admin@admin.com'
export INK_PASSWORD='abc12345'
export MAILER_USER='xpub@sandbox9af3d5dc64334deca9759efe7056d6b3.mailgun.org'
export MAILER_PASSWORD='xpubpass'
export MAILER_SENDER='dev@example.com'
export MAILER_HOSTNAME='smtp.mailgun.org'
export PASSWORD_RESET_URL='http://localhost:3000/password-reset'
export PASSWORD_RESET_SENDER='dev@example.com'
export NODE_ENV='development'
```



Create a database and enter credentials for an admin user account (a postgres db should already be up and running):
```sh
source config/development.env && yarn resetdb
```

Follow the prompts to enter user credentials and complete the database setup.

_**Note**: If you want to use a non-default database, see [Pubsweet development setup](https://gitlab.coko.foundation/pubsweet/pubsweet/wikis/Development:%20setup#setup-2)._

Get the database docker container up and running:  
```sh
source config/development.env && yarn start:services
```

You're good to go. Open a separate terminal in the same folder and run the app with:  
```sh
source config/development.env && yarn server
```

Clean your docker cache and containers before the first time you run the application (under editoria-app) or if changes occur in either env variables, docker-compose.yml, local-development, local-production, etc.:
```sh
docker-compose down
docker-compose rm -fv
rm -rf data
```
